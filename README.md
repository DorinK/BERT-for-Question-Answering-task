# BERT-for-Question-Answering-task
Final project in 'Practical topics in Machine Learning' course by Dr. Kfir Bar at Bar-Ilan University.

In this project, I chose to experiment with the **Transfer Learning technique** by using BERT model and the reading comprehension question answering task,
that is I picked up **pre-trained BERT language model** and tried to fine-tune it, with two different fine-tuning techniques, on the Question Answering task
using SQuAD2.0 dataset.

My best model has achieved an **F1 score of 74.008** and **EM score of 69.434** on the dev set.
